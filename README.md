🌱 Fertilizer Prediction System for Farmers

📌 Objective of Project
The objective of this project is to help farmers choose the most suitable fertilizer for their crops based on soil parameters and environmental conditions.
This system solves a real-world problem by reducing crop failure, improving soil health, and ensuring better yield with the right fertilizer recommendation.

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about soil nutrients, environmental factors, and crop types mapped to the recommended fertilizers.
It provides real agricultural conditions that can be used to train a machine learning model for predicting the best fertilizer.

Features

Soil Information:
Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels
pH levels and other soil properties

Climate Data:
Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Rainfall (mm)

Crop Labels:
Categorical labels for crops (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Maize, etc.)

Fertilizer Data:
Recommendations for fertilizers based on soil type and nutrient deficiencies
Includes details for common fertilizers such as Urea, DAP, MOP, and Organic Manure
Provides insights into the type and quantity of fertilizer needed to improve soil health and crop yield

🌍 Applications
	•	Helps farmers improve crop productivity by choosing the right fertilizer.
	•	Reduces overuse/underuse of fertilizers, preventing soil damage.
	•	Supports sustainable farming practices.
	•	Can be integrated into mobile/web apps for easy farmer access.

🔍 Sample Dataset Insights

Some key insights observed from the dataset include:
	•	Fertilizer requirements vary strongly with N (Nitrogen), P (Phosphorous), and K (Potassium) levels.
	•	Soil Type and Crop Type also play a major role in selecting fertilizers.
	•	Humidity and temperature affect fertilizer performance but are less influential than nutrient levels.
	•	Example:
	•	High Nitrogen deficiency → Urea is recommended.
	•	Low Phosphorous → DAP is suitable.
